# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project utilizes html, javascript, Open Weather API, bootstrap, moment.js, and jQuery to create a dashboard that allows users to search for weather in a city, get the current weather for that city, and see a five-day forecast for the city.

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Credits
I used several sources including Stack Overflow, module 6 lessons, Open Weather documentation, and a search that led me to https://  github.com/Thenlie/ weather-dashboard which helped me compare my code and refactor it to set searched city names to local storage and to lay out card containers.
